## Tv Shows

Tv Shows is simple sample app that fetches most popular tv shows using [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) public API. In the show details there is list of similar shows. 

This is an example how to build an app with MVVM architecture. Android MVVM + Kotlin + Architecture Components + Dagger2 + RxJava2.

Note that release build, signing and proguard rules are not configured. 

### Architecture

App uses MVVM architecture using [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html), specifically `ViewModel` and `LiveData`. Thanks to that ViewModel survives configuration chagnes, like orientation chagne. 

App uses Retrofit and RxJava2 to fetch the data from tmdb api. Afterwards, data is exposed to activity/fragmet using `LiveData`. 

App uses Dagger2 for dependency injection. I used new injection API introduced in `2.12` version of dagger. Thanks to that activities/fragments are totally not aware of injection process. 

Before that API was introduced, activity had to hold reference to dagger components.
